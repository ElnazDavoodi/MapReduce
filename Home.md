**What is Big Data?**

Big Data is not a well-defined concept. One considers terabytes of data as big, one doesn't! A reasonable definition of big data could be *''data which cannot be processed on a single machine easily.''*

We don't need to restrict ourselves to one data processing technique. Map reduce technique can be used for processing a small batch of data. Traditional data processing techniques can be used to process larger batch of data.

**The 3 Vâ€™s of Big Data:** 

When we talk about big data, three concepts can be discussed: **Volume** (i.e. size) of the data we are dealing with, **Variety** in data (i.e. different formatting, different sources, etc.) and **Velocity** (speed) of generating data.
